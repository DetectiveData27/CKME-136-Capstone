Career Village Recommender System
Abstract:
The U.S. has almost 500 students for every guidance counselor. Underprivileged youth lack the network to find their career role models, making CareerVillage.org the only option for millions of young people in America and around the globe with nowhere else to turn. CareerVillage.org is a non-profit that crowdsources career advice for youth. The platform has now served career advice from 25,000 volunteer professionals to over 3.5M online learners. The platform uses a Q&A style similar to StackOverflow or Quora to provide students with answers to any question about any career.
Our objective: Develop a method to recommend relevant questions to the professionals who are most likely to answer them so that, the right questions reach the professionals and they are more likely answer them.
